Create an educational GUI program for children that distinguishes between vowels and consonants as the user clicks buttons. Create an array of Buttons of size of 26, each labelled with a different letter of the alphabet (Must use Loops/Classes to code the button, Should not code 26 buttons separately). Display the Buttons with letters ‘A’ to ‘J’ on the first row, ‘K’ to ‘T’ on the second row, and the rest of the letters on the 3rd row. When the user clicks a Button, a Label’s text should change to identify the button’s letter as a vowel or consonant. Display the application with a Title displaying your name on the upper left corner.
